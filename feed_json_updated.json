Evolving Infrastructure for LLMs and Beyond</h1>\n<p>The field of machine learning has undergone a seismic shift with the rise of large-scale foundation models - from giant language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. As a result, the way we build and operate ML systems (MLOps) looks very different today than it did just a few years ago. In this post, we'll explore how ML infrastructure and MLOps practices have evolved - contrasting the \"classic\" era of MLOps with the modern paradigms emerging to support foundation models. We'll highlight what's changed, what new patterns and workflows have emerged.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-05-05T20:52:08+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": ["infrastructure", "llmops", "mlops"]}]}

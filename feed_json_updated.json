It looks like a secret code, but the short answer is: <strong>they tell you two critical things.</strong></p>\n<p>Open-source LLMs vary along <strong>two independent dimensions</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Model variant</strong> \u2013 the suffix in the name (<code>-Instruct</code>, <code>-Distill</code>, <code>-A3B</code>, etc.) describes <em>how</em> the model was trained and <em>what</em> it's optimized for.</li>\n<li><strong>File format</strong> \u2013 the extension (<code>.gguf</code>, <code>.gptq</code>, <code>.awq</code>, etc.) describes <em>how</em> the weights are stored and <em>where</em> they run best (CPU, GPU, mobile, etc.).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Think of it like this: the <strong>model variant is the recipe</strong>, and the <strong>file format is the container</strong>. You can put the same soup (recipe) into a thermos, a bowl, or a takeout box (container) depending on where you plan to eat it.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"LLM Variant vs Format\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-11-llm-variant-guide/llm_variant_vs_format.svg\" /></p>\n<p>Understanding both dimensions helps you avoid downloading 20 GB of the wrong model at midnight and then spending hours debugging CUDA errors.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"model-variants-explained-the-recipe\">Model variants explained (the recipe)</h2>\n<p>This is about the <em>brain</em> of the model. How was it taught?</p>\n<h3 id=\"base-models\">Base models</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> The raw, pre-trained model straight from the training run. Think of it as the unfiltered brain that learned language patterns from massive text datasets (the entire internet) but hasn't been taught to follow instructions. It just predicts the next word.</p>\n<p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You're planning to <strong>fine-tune</strong> it for your specific domain.</li>\n<li>You're doing research and need the \"pure\" foundation.</li>\n<li>You want maximum creative freedom (no safety guardrails).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Won't reliably follow instructions. If you ask \"What is the capital of France?\", it might reply \"and what is the capital of Germany?\" because it thinks it's completing a list of questions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"instruct-chat-models\">Instruct / Chat models</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A base model that went through additional training (Supervised Fine-Tuning + RLHF) to understand and follow human instructions. This is what most people actually want when they say \"I want an LLM.\"</p>\n<p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building chatbots, AI agents, or RAG applications.</li>\n<li>Function calling and tool use.</li>\n<li>Day-to-day coding assistance.</li>\n<li><strong>95% of production use cases.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Slightly larger and slower than base models due to the extra training layers. May be less \"creative\" due to alignment training that makes it more predictable and helpful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reasoning-cot-models-new\">Reasoning / CoT Models (New!)</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A new breed of models (like DeepSeek-R1 or o1-derivatives) trained with \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT) reinforcement learning. They \"think\" before they speak, generating internal reasoning tokens to solve complex logic, math, or coding problems before outputting the final answer.</p>\n<p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complex coding tasks and debugging.</li>\n<li>Math problems and logic puzzles.</li>\n<li>When you need the model to double-check its work and avoid hallucinations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> <strong>Slower inference</strong>. They generate many \"thought\" tokens that you might not see but still have to wait for. They can also be overly verbose for simple \"hello world\" tasks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"distilled-models\">Distilled models</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A smaller \"student\" model trained to mimic the behavior of a larger \"teacher\" model. Think of it as compressed knowledge\u2014you get 70-80% of the performance at 30-50% of the size.</p>\n<p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile or edge devices with limited resources.</li>\n<li>Cost-sensitive SaaS where every millisecond counts.</li>\n<li>High-throughput scenarios where you need to serve many requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Some loss in complex reasoning ability, but excellent efficiency. The token-per-watt ratio is hard to beat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"moe-mixture-of-experts-a3b-a22b-etc\">MoE (Mixture-of-Experts): A3B, A22B, etc.</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A clever architecture where the model has many \"expert\" sub-networks, but only activates a subset for each token. \"A3B\" means \"3 billion parameters active\" out of a much larger total (often 30B+).</p>\n<p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want \"big model\" smarts but only have 12-24 GB VRAM.</li>\n<li>You need the reasoning power of a 30B model but with 7B inference costs.</li>\n<li>You're running locally and want the best performance-per-memory ratio.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Takes more disk space (you're storing all the experts). Not every inference framework supports MoE routing yet\u2014check compatibility first.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Choosing Model Variant\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-11-llm-variant-guide/choose_model_variant.svg\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with an <strong>Instruct</strong> model\u2014it's what most people need.</li>\n<li>Hit memory or latency limits? Try a <strong>Distilled</strong> or <strong>MoE</strong> variant.</li>\n<li>Need to solve a complex riddle? Try a <strong>Reasoning</strong> model.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"file-formats-explained-the-container\">File formats explained (the container)</h2>\n<p>Now that you know <em>what</em> kind of model you want, you need to pick <em>how</em> it's packaged. File formats determine where your model runs best and how much memory it needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quantization-101-why-do-we-shrink-models\">Quantization 101: Why do we shrink models?</h3>\n<p>Before we talk formats, let's talk <strong>Quantization</strong>.\nStandard models use 16-bit numbers (FP16) for every weight. That's precise but huge.\nQuantization reduces these to 8-bit, 4-bit, or even 2-bit numbers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FP16</strong>: 2 bytes per parameter. (13B model \u2248 26 GB)</li>\n<li><strong>4-bit</strong>: 0.5 bytes per parameter. (13B model \u2248 6.5 GB)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You lose a tiny bit of \"intelligence\" but gain massive speed and memory savings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gguf-gguf\">GGUF (<code>.gguf</code>)</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> The successor to GGML and now the <strong>de-facto standard for local inference</strong>. A single file that contains the model weights, metadata, and even the prompt template.</p>\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)</strong>: It works natively with Metal acceleration.</li>\n<li><strong>CPU Inference</strong>: If you don't have a dedicated GPU.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy Setup</strong>: Works with <code>llama.cpp</code>, Ollama, and LM Studio.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why it's great:</strong> One file, works everywhere. Supports multiple quantization levels.</p>\n<h4 id=\"decoding-gguf-names-q3_k_m-q5_k_m-etc\">Decoding GGUF Names (Q3_K_M, Q5_K_M, etc.)</h4>\n<p>You'll often see a long list of files like <code>Q3_K_M</code>, <code>Q4_K_S</code>, <code>Q5_K_M</code>. These aren't random; they are specific \"K-quant\" formats.</p>\n<p><strong>How to read <code>Q3_K_M</code>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Q3</strong>: Average <strong>3-bit</strong> quantization for the weights.</li>\n<li><strong>K</strong>: Uses the <strong>K-quant</strong> scheme (a newer, smarter quantization method that uses non-uniform precision).</li>\n<li><strong>M</strong>: <strong>Medium</strong> block size. This refers to the internal layout (<code>S</code> = Small, <code>L</code> = Large).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Which one should you pick?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Q3_K_M (The \"Budget\" Choice)</strong>: Use when you are tight on memory. It has a noticeable quality drop but allows you to run larger models on weaker hardware.</li>\n<li><strong>Q4_K_M (The \"Standard\")</strong>: The sweet spot. Best balance of speed, size, and perplexity. Indistinguishable from uncompressed for most tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Q5_K_M (The \"Premium\")</strong>: Use if you have VRAM to spare. Quality is very close to FP16 / Q8 while still being quite compact.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> It is often better to run a <strong>larger model at lower quantization</strong> (e.g., Llama-70B at Q3) than a <strong>smaller model at high quantization</strong> (e.g., Llama-8B at Q8). Intelligence scales with parameter count more than precision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"gptq-safetensors-configjson\">GPTQ (<code>.safetensors</code> + <code>config.json</code>)</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Post-training quantization optimized specifically for <strong>Nvidia GPUs</strong>. It uses second-order information to minimize accuracy loss when compressing.</p>\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Production Servers</strong>: Running on Linux with Nvidia GPUs (CUDA).</li>\n<li><strong>High Throughput</strong>: Very fast inference at 4-bit.</li>\n<li><strong>ExLlamaV2</strong>: Can be run with the ExLlamaV2 loader for extreme speed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Requires a GPU. Won't run efficiently on CPU or Mac.</p>\n<h3 id=\"awq-safetensors\">AWQ (<code>.safetensors</code>)</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Activation-Aware Weight Quantization. It analyzes which weights matter most during inference and preserves their precision better than naive quantization.</p>\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Often matches FP16 accuracy more closely than GPTQ at 4-bit.</li>\n<li><strong>vLLM</strong>: Supported natively by the vLLM serving engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why it's great:</strong> It's \"smarter\" quantization. If you care about squeezing every drop of quality out of a 4-bit model, AWQ is often the winner.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pytorch-safetensors-fp16bf16\">PyTorch / Safetensors (FP16/BF16)</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Full-precision weights with no quantization. The original format most models are released in.</p>\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cloud inference</strong> with powerful GPUs (A100, H100).</li>\n<li><strong>Fine-tuning</strong> and continued training.</li>\n<li>When accuracy is paramount and memory isn't a constraint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Largest memory and disk footprint. A 70B model in FP16 needs ~140 GB VRAM!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Choosing File Format\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-11-llm-variant-guide/choose_file_format.svg\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When in doubt, start with <strong>GGUF Q4_K_M</strong>. It's the Swiss Army knife of LLM formats\u2014runs on 8GB VRAM GPUs, modern CPUs, and everything in between. You can always optimize later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"how-to-actually-run-these-serving-engines\">How to actually run these? (Serving Engines)</h2>\n<p>You have the file. Now what?

The <em>method</em> matters. AWQ typically preserves more accuracy than naive GPTQ.</p>\n<h3 id=\"moe-models-work-with-any-inference-engine\">\"MoE models work with any inference engine\"</h3>\n<p><strong>Not yet.</strong> <code>llama.cpp</code> handles MoE routing well. Support in other engines varies. Always check compatibility before downloading a 50GB MoE model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"distilled-models-are-just-smaller-versions\">\"Distilled models are just smaller versions\"</h3>\n<p><strong>Nope.</strong> A distilled 7B model can outperform a vanilla 13B model because it learned from a much larger teacher (often 70B+). It's compressed <em>knowledge</em>, not just compressed <em>parameters</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-should-quantize-my-qat-model-further-to-save-space\">\"I should quantize my QAT model further to save space\"</h3>\n<p><strong>Don't.</strong> QAT models were already trained in low-bit precision.

With the right approach, you can scale from a single GPU to thousands, training models that would have been impossible just a few years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Further resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook\">Hugging Face Ultra-Scale Playbook</a> - Interactive guide with more details</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html\">PyTorch FSDP Tutorial</a> - Official getting started guide</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/\">DeepSpeed Tutorials</a> - Comprehensive DeepSpeed documentation</li>\n</ul>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-11-24T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Viacheslav Dubrov"}], "tags": ["Deep Learning", "Distributed Training", "GPU", "LLM", "Parallelism"]}, {"id": "https://slavadubrov.github.io/blog/2025/04/17/quick-guide-managing-python-on-macos-with-uv/", "url": "https://slavadubrov.github.io/blog/2025/04/17/quick-guide-managing-python-on-macos-with-uv/", "title": "Quick Guide: Managing Python on macOS with uv", "content_html": "<h2 id=\"quick-start\">Quick Start</h2>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><a id=\"__codelineno-0-1\" name=\"__codelineno-0-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-1\"></a><span class=\"c1\"># Install uv</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-2\" name=\"__codelineno-0-2\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-2\"></a>brew<span class=\"w\"> </span>install<span class=\"w\"> </span>uv\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-3\" name=\"__codelineno-0-3\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-3\"></a>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-4\" name=\"__codelineno-0-4\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-4\"></a><span class=\"c1\"># For new projects (modern workflow)</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-5\" name=\"__codelineno-0-5\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-5\"></a>uv<span class=\"w\"> </span>init<span class=\"w\">                </span><span class=\"c1\"># create project structure</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-6\" name=\"__codelineno-0-6\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-6\"></a>uv<span class=\"w\"> </span>add<span class=\"w\"> </span>pandas<span class=\"w\"> </span>numpy<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"c1\"># add dependencies</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-7\" name=\"__codelineno-0-7\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-7\"></a>uv<span class=\"w\"> </span>run<span class=\"w\"> </span>train.py<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"c1\"># run your script</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-8\" name=\"__codelineno-0-8\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-8\"></a>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-9\" name=\"__codelineno-0-9\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-9\"></a><span class=\"c1\"># For existing projects (legacy workflow)</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-10\" name=\"__codelineno-0-10\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-10\"></a>uv<span class=\"w\"> </span>venv<span class=\"w\">                             </span><span class=\"c1\"># create virtual environment</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-11\" name=\"__codelineno-0-11\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-11\"></a>uv<span class=\"w\"> </span>pip<span class=\"w\"> </span>install<span class=\"w\"> </span>-r<span class=\"w\"> </span>requirements.txt<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\"># install dependencies</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-12\" name=\"__codelineno-0-12\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-12\"></a>uv<span class=\"w\"> </span>run<span class=\"w\"> </span>train.py<span class=\"w\">                     </span><span class=\"c1\"># run your script</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-13\" name=\"__codelineno-0-13\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-13\"></a>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-14\" name=\"__codelineno-0-14\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-14\"></a><span class=\"c1\"># Run tools without installing them</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-15\" name=\"__codelineno-0-15\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-15\"></a>uvx<span class=\"w\"> </span>ruff<span class=\"w\"> </span>check<span class=\"w\"> </span>.<span class=\"w\">       </span><span class=\"c1\"># run linter</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-16\" name=\"__codelineno-0-16\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-16\"></a>uvx<span class=\"w\"> </span>black<span class=\"w\"> </span>.<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"c1\"># run formatter</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"why-uv\">Why uv?</h2>\n<p>If you've been using Python for a while, you're likely familiar with the \"tool fatigue\" of managing <code>pip</code>, <code>virtualenv</code>, <code>pip-tools</code>, <code>pyenv</code>, and <code>poetry</code>.</p>\n<p><strong><code>uv</code> replaces all of them.</strong></p>\n<p>Written in Rust, it is designed to be a drop-in replacement that is <strong>10-100x faster</strong> than existing tools.

We'll cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What LoRA is</strong> and why it's a game-changer.</li>\n<li><strong>LoRAX vs. vLLM</strong>: When to use which.</li>\n<li><strong>Kubernetes Deployment</strong>: A production-ready Helm guide.</li>\n<li><strong>API Usage</strong>: REST, Python, and OpenAI-compatible examples.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"background-what-is-lora\">Background: What is LoRA?</h2>\n<p><strong>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)</strong> is a fine-tuning technique that freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture.</p>\n<p>In simple terms: instead of retraining the entire model (which is slow and produces massive files), LoRA trains a tiny set of \"diffs\" that represent the new knowledge.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full Fine-tuning</strong>: Produces a 20GB+ file for a 7B model.</li>\n<li><strong>LoRA Fine-tuning</strong>: Produces a ~100MB adapter file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This massive size reduction is what makes dynamic serving possible. You can store thousands of adapters on disk and load them into GPU memory in milliseconds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-lorax-solves\">The problem LoRAX solves</h2>\n<p>Traditional multi-model serving is expensive. Each fine-tuned model needs its own GPU memory allocation, which means serving 50 customer-specific models requires 50 separate deployments\u2014or at least 50x the memory. The costs scale linearly with every new variant you add.</p>\n<p>LoRAX is an Apache 2.0 project from <a href=\"https://github.com/predibase/lorax\">Predibase</a> that extends the <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference\">Hugging Face Text Generation Inference server</a> with three critical features: dynamic adapter loading, tiered weight caching, and multi-adapter batching. These let you serve hundreds of tenant-specific LoRA adapters on a single Ampere-class GPU without sacrificing throughput or latency.</p>\n<p>Here's the key insight: LoRA fine-tuning produces small delta weights (adapters) rather than full model copies. LoRAX exploits this by loading just the base model into GPU memory and injecting adapter weights on demand. Unused adapters consume zero VRAM.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works-four-core-innovations\">How it works: four core innovations</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Dynamic adapter loading</strong>\nAdapter weights are injected just-in-time for each request. The base model stays resident in GPU memory while adapters load on the fly without blocking other requests. This means you can catalog thousands of adapters but only pay memory costs for the ones actively serving traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Tiered weight caching</strong>\nLoRAX stages adapters across three layers: GPU VRAM for hot adapters, CPU RAM for warm ones, and disk for cold storage. This hierarchy prevents out-of-memory crashes while keeping swap times fast enough that users don't notice the difference.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Continuous multi-adapter batching</strong>\nHere's where the magic happens. LoRAX extends continuous batching strategies to work across different adapters in parallel. Requests targeting different fine-tunes can share the same forward pass, keeping the GPU fully utilized. Benchmarks from Predibase show that processing 1M tokens spread across 32 different adapters takes about the same time as 1M tokens on a single model.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Battle-tested foundation</strong>\nLoRAX builds on Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference (TGI) server, inheriting production-grade optimizations: FlashAttention 2, paged attention, SGMV kernels for multi-adapter inference, and streaming responses. You get the stability of TGI plus the flexibility of dynamic adapter switching.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-economics-near-constant-cost-scaling\">The economics: near-constant cost scaling</h3>\n<p>The chart below demonstrates the cost advantage. While traditional dedicated deployments (dark gray) scale linearly\u2014double the models means double the cost\u2014LoRAX (orange) keeps per-token costs nearly flat regardless of how many adapters you serve. Even hosted API fine-tunes from providers like OpenAI (light gray) can't match this efficiency for multi-model scenarios.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"LoRAX cost per million tokens vs number of models\" src=\"https://slavadubrov.github.io/blog/assets/2025-10-22-lorax-serving-guide/lorax-performance.png\" /></p>\n<p><em>Cost per million tokens as the number of fine-tuned models increases. LoRAX maintains near-constant costs through efficient multi-adapter batching, while dedicated deployments scale linearly.

Here's when it shines:</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-tenant SaaS applications</strong>\nYou're building a platform where each of your 500 customers gets a customized chatbot fine-tuned on their data. Traditional serving would require 500 model deployments. LoRAX serves all 500 from a single GPU by loading the relevant adapter when a customer request arrives.</p>\n<p><strong>Domain-specific expert routers</strong>\nYour company maintains specialized LLMs for law, medicine, finance, and engineering. Instead of four separate 13B model deployments, LoRAX runs one base LLaMA 2 13B instance and routes to the appropriate adapter based on the incoming request domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Rapid experimentation and A/B testing</strong>\nTesting 10 different fine-tuning approaches in production? With LoRAX you deploy once and switch between variants by changing the <code>adapter_id</code> parameter. No infrastructure changes, no service restarts.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource-constrained or edge deployments</strong>\nOn-prem installations or edge devices often have limited GPU resources. A single NVIDIA A10G can host a quantized 7B base model plus dozens of task-specific adapters, eliminating the need for one GPU per model.</p>\n<h2 id=\"architecture-memory-hierarchy-and-request-scheduling\">Architecture: memory hierarchy and request scheduling</h2>\n<p>The core of LoRAX is its three-tier memory hierarchy. Understanding this helps you predict performance and plan capacity.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"LoRAX Memory Hierarchy\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-10-22-lorax-serving-guide/lorax-memory-hierarchy.svg\" /></p>\n<p>LoRAX treats each adapter as a lightweight \"view\" on the shared base model. The scheduler coalesces requests so that serving 32 different adapters can be as fast as serving one\u2014even across a million tokens of throughput. Adapters typically weigh 10-200MB each, compared to multi-gigabyte full models.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deploy-lorax-on-kubernetes\">Deploy LoRAX on Kubernetes</h2>\n<p>LoRAX ships with production-ready Helm charts and Docker images, making Kubernetes deployment straightforward.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>Before you start, ensure you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Kubernetes cluster with NVIDIA GPUs (Ampere generation or newer: A10, A100, H100)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html\">NVIDIA Container Runtime</a> configured on GPU nodes</li>\n<li><code>kubectl</code> and <code>helm</code> installed locally</li>\n<li>Persistent storage for adapter caches\u2014mount a PersistentVolume to <code>/data</code> in the pod</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"quick-start-with-the-official-helm-chart\">Quick start with the official Helm chart</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://helm.sh/\">Helm</a> is the package manager for Kubernetes\u2014it simplifies deploying applications by bundling all the necessary Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) into a single \"chart.\" Instead of writing and managing dozens of YAML files manually, you can deploy complex applications with a single command.</p>\n<p>Predibase retired their public Helm repository in late 2024, so the supported workflow is to clone the LoRAX repository and install the chart from disk.

Plan for this in user-facing applications by preloading popular adapters or showing loading states.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trade-offs-to-consider\">Trade-offs to consider</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-lorax-does-well\">What LoRAX does well</h3>\n<p><strong>Dramatic cost reduction for multi-model scenarios</strong>\nServe hundreds or thousands of fine-tuned models on a single GPU. Traditional approaches would require separate deployments for each model, multiplying infrastructure costs linearly. LoRAX keeps costs nearly constant as you add adapters.</p>\n<p><strong>Zero memory waste</strong>\nAdapters are loaded just-in-time when requests arrive. Unused models consume no VRAM. This means you can maintain a catalog of 1,000+ specialized models but only pay for the handful actively serving traffic at any moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Production-grade performance</strong>\nContinuous multi-adapter batching keeps latency and throughput comparable to single-model serving. Predibase benchmarks show that serving 32 different adapters simultaneously adds minimal overhead compared to serving one model.</p>\n<p><strong>Proven foundation</strong>\nBuilt on Hugging Face TGI, LoRAX inherits battle-tested optimizations: FlashAttention 2, paged attention, streaming token generation, and SGMV kernels for efficient multi-adapter inference.</p>\n<p><strong>Deployment maturity</strong>\nShips with Docker images, Helm charts, Prometheus metrics, and OpenTelemetry tracing. The Apache 2.0 license means you can use it commercially without restrictions.</p>\n<p><strong>Broad model support</strong>\nWorks with popular open-source architectures: LLaMA 2, CodeLlama, Mistral, Mixtral, Qwen, and more. Supports quantization (4-bit via bitsandbytes, GPTQ, AWQ) to reduce memory footprint.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitations-and-constraints\">Limitations and constraints</h3>\n<p><strong>Tied to LoRA-based fine-tuning</strong>\nAll your adapters must come from LoRA-style fine-tuning of the same base model. Full fine-tunes that produce standalone models won't work without conversion. If you have completely different model architectures, you'll need separate LoRAX deployments for each base.</p>\n<p><strong>Cold start latency</strong>\nThe first request after startup loads the base model into GPU memory (can take 30-90 seconds for larger models). First-time adapter requests also incur a download delay if pulling from Hugging Face. Plan for this with health checks and preloading strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Cache thrashing under bursty load</strong>\nIf traffic suddenly hits dozens of different adapters, LoRAX may shuffle weights between GPU, CPU RAM, and disk. While adapter swaps are fast (~10ms from RAM), a very large working set can cause temporary slowdowns. Monitor GPU memory and adapter cache hit rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast-moving project</strong>\nLoRAX forked from TGI in late 2023 and evolves rapidly. Expect frequent updates and occasional breaking changes as the maintainers track upstream TGI improvements and add new features. Pin versions carefully in production.</p>\n<h2 id=\"alternatives-lorax-vs-vllm\">Alternatives: LoRAX vs. vLLM</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\">vLLM</a> is another popular high-throughput serving engine that recently added multi-LoRA support.

Verify that adapter loading works and measure baseline latency for your workload.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-measure-and-profile\">2. Measure and profile</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Track adapter cache hit rates and GPU memory usage under realistic traffic patterns</li>\n<li>Identify your \"hot\" adapters (top 20% by request volume) and consider preloading them at startup</li>\n<li>Measure P50, P95, and P99 latency for both cached and cold adapter loads</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-optimize-for-your-workload\">3. Optimize for your workload</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a few very popular adapters, increase GPU memory allocation to keep more adapters hot</li>\n<li>If you have long-tail usage across hundreds of adapters, tune the tiered cache settings to balance RAM and disk</li>\n<li>Use quantization (4-bit bitsandbytes or GPTQ) if VRAM is tight</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4-scale-horizontally\">4. Scale horizontally</h3>\n<p>Once you understand single-instance behavior, add replicas for high availability. Place a load balancer in front that routes based on <code>adapter_id</code> to improve cache locality\u2014requests for the same adapter hitting the same replica means better cache utilization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-monitor-continuously\">5. Monitor continuously</h3>\n<p>Set up dashboards for GPU utilization, adapter cache metrics, and request latency broken down by adapter. Watch for cache thrashing during traffic spikes and adjust your scaling strategy accordingly.</p>\n<p>With LoRAX, orchestrating specialized LLM experiences becomes a matter of routing adapter IDs\u2014not provisioning endless GPUs.

You've seen it\u2014business teams ask for a \"policy check\" and get back a <code>process_data()</code> method. Nobody knows what it does, so requirements drift and systems calcify.</p>\n<p>Domain-driven design (DDD) fixes this by putting the <strong>business domain</strong> at the center. Not the database schema. Not the prompt template. The actual real-world process you're trying to model. This alignment delivers three immediate wins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shared language.</strong> Everyone\u2014product, ops, engineering\u2014uses the same words. When compliance says \"refund request\", that's what appears in your code, prompts, and documentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Focused scope.</strong> You build what matters: the core workflows, compliance rules, and critical metrics. Not mountains of glue code that break when requirements shift.</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptability.</strong> When policies change (and they will), you update one well-defined slice instead of hunting through a monolithic tangle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This matters most in complex domains where rules evolve constantly\u2014think finance, healthcare, operations, or any regulated industry. DDD gives you a fighting chance to keep up.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"strategic-building-blocks\">Strategic building blocks</h2>\n<p>DDD isn't one big idea\u2014it's a toolkit of patterns that work together. It's often split into two parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Strategic Design</strong>: The \"big picture\" stuff. Defining boundaries, teams, and how systems talk. This is crucial for multi-agent systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Tactical Design</strong>: The code-level patterns (Entities, Aggregates). This keeps your agent's internal logic clean.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are the core concepts you'll use every day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ubiquitous-language\">Ubiquitous language</h3>\n<p>This is the shared vocabulary that shows up everywhere: in meetings, documentation, prompts, and method names. No translation layers between \"business speak\" and \"code speak.\"</p>\n<p>If compliance says \"policy check\", your method is <code>run_policy_check()</code>, not <code>process_data()</code>. If doctors say \"admit patient\", you write <code>admit_patient()</code>, not <code>add_user()</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><a id=\"__codelineno-0-1\" name=\"__codelineno-0-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-1\"></a><span class=\"k\">class</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">PatientRegistry</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-2\" name=\"__codelineno-0-2\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-2\"></a>    <span class=\"k\">def</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">admit_patient</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">patient_id</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"kc\">None</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-3\" name=\"__codelineno-0-3\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-3\"></a><span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"sd\">&quot;&quot;&quot;Admit a patient to the registry - term used by medical staff.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-4\" name=\"__codelineno-0-4\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-4\"></a>        <span class=\"o\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This eliminates translation gaps and makes code self-documenting. When requirements change, the language change is obvious and localized.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bounded-contexts\">Bounded contexts</h3>\n<p>Large systems need explicit boundaries. Why? Because the same word means different things in different parts of the business.</p>\n<p>Take \"product\" in e-commerce. In the <strong>Inventory</strong> context, a product is a catalog item with SKUs and stock counts. In the <strong>Billing</strong> context, it's a line item with pricing rules and tax calculations. In <strong>Order Management</strong>, it's a quantity and delivery promise.</p>\n<p>Bounded contexts let each subdomain have its own definition without conflict. Translation layers or interfaces connect them when they need to talk.</p>\n<p>Bounded contexts let each subdomain have its own definition without conflict.

Understanding the difference is key.</p>\n<p><strong>Entities</strong> have identity that persists over time. A <code>Task</code> with ID <code>123</code> is the same task even if you change its description, status, or due date. Two entities are equal if they have the same ID, regardless of their attributes.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><a id=\"__codelineno-1-1\" name=\"__codelineno-1-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-1\"></a><span class=\"kn\">from</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">pydantic</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">BaseModel</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-2\" name=\"__codelineno-1-2\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-2\"></a>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-3\" name=\"__codelineno-1-3\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-3\"></a><span class=\"k\">class</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">SupportTicket</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">BaseModel</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-4\" name=\"__codelineno-1-4\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-4\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">ticket_id</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># This is the identity</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-5\" name=\"__codelineno-1-5\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-5\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">customer</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-6\" name=\"__codelineno-1-6\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-6\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">issue</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-7\" name=\"__codelineno-1-7\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-7\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">status</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;OPEN&quot;</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-8\" name=\"__codelineno-1-8\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-8\"></a>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-9\" name=\"__codelineno-1-9\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-9\"></a>    <span class=\"k\">def</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">close</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"kc\">None</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-10\" name=\"__codelineno-1-10\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-10\"></a>        <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">status</span> <span class=\"o\">!=</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;OPEN&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-11\" name=\"__codelineno-1-11\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-11\"></a>            <span class=\"k\">raise</span> <span class=\"ne\">ValueError</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;Ticket already closed&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-12\" name=\"__codelineno-1-12\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-12\"></a>        <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">status</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;CLOSED&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>Value objects</strong> have no identity\u2014they're defined entirely by their attributes.

A notification service might listen for this event and send an email. A reporting service might log it for analytics. The important part: the task aggregate doesn't need to know about emails or analytics. It just announces what happened.</p>\n<p>This decouples workflows and makes cross-context communication clean. It's especially powerful in multi-agent systems where agents react to each other's events.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"translating-ddd-to-agent-architectures\">Translating DDD to agent architectures</h2>\n<p>AI agents deal with complexity\u2014multi-step workflows, unreliable LLM outputs, evolving requirements. DDD's patterns map surprisingly well to these challenges. Here's how the concepts translate:</p>\n<h3 id=\"bounded-contexts-become-agents-or-skills\">Bounded contexts become agents or skills</h3>\n<p>Each agent (or major capability) is a bounded context. A research orchestrator might coordinate three specialized agents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trends Agent</strong> \u2014 gathers market data using its own vocabulary and tools</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance Agent</strong> \u2014 runs policy checks with regulatory terminology</li>\n<li><strong>Cost Agent</strong> \u2014 estimates expenses with finance-specific rules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each has its own model, terminology, and invariants. They communicate through well-defined interfaces or events.</p>\n<p>Each has its own model, terminology, and invariants. They communicate through well-defined interfaces or events.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Agent Orchestration\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-10-20-domain-driven-design-ai-agents/agent_orchestration.svg\" /></p>\n<p>Even in a single-agent system, you might define internal contexts\u2014a Planning module and an Execution module, each with its own domain model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prompts-honor-the-ubiquitous-language\">Prompts honor the ubiquitous language</h3>\n<p>Use domain terms in system prompts, tool descriptions, and function signatures. If compliance experts say \"policy check\", that exact phrase appears in your prompts and code. This keeps humans and agents synchronized and makes the system easier to review and debug.</p>\n<h3 id=\"state-becomes-explicit-entities\">State becomes explicit entities</h3>\n<p>LLMs are often stateless, but complex agents maintain state\u2014conversation sessions, goals, intermediate results, tool outputs. Model these as entities or value objects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ConversationSession</code> entity with ID and message history</li>\n<li><code>Task</code> entity representing units of work</li>\n<li><code>ToolOutput</code> value object for immutable results</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explicit modeling enables validation, business rules, and reuse. You can enforce rules like \"a task can't be completed until dependencies finish\" directly in the entity methods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aggregates-express-agent-plans\">Aggregates express agent plans</h3>\n<p>A <code>Plan</code> aggregate root can govern task lists, enforce limits, and maintain priorities. When an LLM proposes adding 50 tasks, the aggregate enforces a maximum of 10. When it suggests duplicate work, the aggregate rejects it. This keeps AI proposals within business constraints.</p>\n<h3 id=\"domain-events-drive-orchestration\">Domain events drive orchestration</h3>\n<p>Agents raise events\u2014<code>ResearchCompleted</code>, <code>ThresholdExceeded</code>, <code>PolicyViolationDetected</code>. Other agents or services listen and react without tight coupling. This event-driven approach is the future of scalable agent systems: it lets multiple agents collaborate in real-time without being hard-wired together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"business-rules-wrap-ai-actions\">Business rules wrap AI actions</h3>\n<p>LLM outputs flow through domain services or entity methods. If an LLM suggests a refund amount beyond policy limits, your <code>RefundRequest</code> value object validates and rejects it. The AI can improvise, but business rules have the final say. This keeps agents safe and aligned with policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-anti-corruption-layer-acl\">The Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)</h3>\n<p>When working with LLMs, you are dealing with a probabilistic, creative, and occasionally chaotic entity. Your domain model, however, must be deterministic and safe. You cannot let the raw output of an LLM leak directly into your domain logic.</p>\n<p>Enter the <strong>Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"LLM Domain Interaction\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-10-20-domain-driven-design-ai-agents/llm_domain_interaction.svg\" /></p>\n<p>The ACL acts as a gatekeeper. It translates the \"wild\" output of the LLM into the \"strict\" language of your domain.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ingest</strong>: Receive raw text or JSON from the LLM.</li>\n<li><strong>Validate</strong>: Use Pydantic models to check structure and types.</li>\n<li><strong>Sanitize</strong>: Ensure values fall within acceptable ranges (e.g., no negative prices).</li>\n<li><strong>Translate</strong>: Convert DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) into Domain Entities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If validation fails, the ACL rejects the data\u2014often sending an error message back to the LLM so it can correct itself. This loop ensures that <strong>only valid data ever touches your core business logic</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"example-a-task-assistant-modeled-with-ddd\">Example: a task assistant modeled with DDD</h2>\n<p>Let's build a personal task assistant that handles requests like \"Remind me to buy milk tomorrow\" or \"What's on my to-do list?\" We'll apply DDD principles step by step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-map-the-contexts\">1. Map the contexts</h3>\n<p>Start by breaking the problem into subdomains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Task Management</strong> \u2014 handling to-do items and reminders (core domain)</li>\n<li><strong>Scheduling</strong> \u2014 calendar events and meetings</li>\n<li><strong>Notifications</strong> \u2014 sending alerts and emails</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We'll focus on Task Management first. The others can evolve as separate bounded contexts or companion agents.</p>\n<p>We'll focus on Task Management first.

Speak the same language</h3>\n<p>Establish the vocabulary with domain experts (or just common sense for personal tasks): \"task\", \"deadline\", \"reminder\", \"priority\".

Capture entities, value objects, and events</h3>\n<p>Now model the core concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Entity:</strong> <code>Task</code> with identity (<code>id</code>) and mutable state

Use it for entities, value objects, and especially for validating LLM outputs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ai.pydantic.dev/\">Pydantic AI</a> takes this further: it ensures LLM responses conform to your domain schemas. Define an <code>AddTaskCommand</code> with required fields, and Pydantic AI validates that the LLM's JSON output matches before you act on it. This brings structure to the chaotic world of AI outputs.</p>\n<p>Another excellent tool is <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/jxnl/instructor\">Instructor</a></strong>, which patches OpenAI (and other) clients to return Pydantic models directly. It's a lightweight way to implement your Anti-Corruption Layer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ddd-helper-libraries\">DDD helper libraries</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/dddesign/\">DDDesign</a></strong> \u2014 provides base classes for entities, repositories, and value objects built on Pydantic</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/proteanhq/protean\">Protean</a></strong> \u2014 a full framework for DDD, CQRS, and event sourcing if you want something that comes with a lot of ready-made features out of the box</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most Python developers skip these and use vanilla classes with Pydantic, but they're worth exploring for large projects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"event-driven-tooling\">Event-driven tooling</h3>\n<p>For domain events, consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/jek/blinker\">blinker</a></strong> \u2014 lightweight in-process event dispatcher</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/redis/redis-py\">redis-py Pub/Sub</a></strong> or <strong><a href=\"https://www.rabbitmq.com/\">RabbitMQ</a></strong> \u2014 for distributed events across services or agents</li>\n<li><strong>asyncio event patterns</strong> \u2014 if you're already async</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Events are crucial for multi-agent orchestration.

Here's your roadmap:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Interview domain experts.</strong> Draft the ubiquitous language\u2014the vocabulary everyone will use. Document it.</li>\n<li><strong>Map bounded contexts.</strong> Draw the subdomains and mark where they need to talk to each other. Start with one core context.</li>\n<li><strong>Model entities and value objects.</strong> What things have identity? What things are just values? Bake invariants into their methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Define aggregate roots.</strong> Bundle related entities under one root that enforces consistency rules.</li>\n<li><strong>Create repository interfaces.</strong> Don't implement storage yet\u2014just define <code>save()</code> and <code>get()</code> methods. Keep the domain clean.</li>\n<li><strong>Emit domain events.</strong> For meaningful changes (order placed, task completed), raise events. Wire listeners later as needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Wrap LLM outputs in schemas.</strong> Use Pydantic models to enforce contracts. Don't let free-form text leak into your domain.</li>\n<li><strong>Add orchestration.</strong> Build application services that coordinate agents via structured commands or events.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The golden rule: <strong>start with the domain, not the tech stack.</strong> Understand the business problem first.

Agentic systems live or die by this layer. Below is a field\u2011tested blueprint and patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The problem</strong>: You build an agent. It works in demos, fails in production. Why? The model gets the wrong context at the wrong time\u2014stale memory, irrelevant docs, no safety checks, ambiguous instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>The fix</strong>: Design the context layer deliberately. This guide shows you how.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"why-now\">Why now</h2>\n<p>Picture this: your customer support agent runs for three weeks. It handles 200 tickets. Then it suddenly starts hallucinating product details, mixing up customers, and calling the wrong APIs. The model didn't get worse\u2014the context did.</p>\n<p>Here's why context engineering became critical in 2025:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agents moved from chat to action.</strong> Multi\u2011step planning, tool use, and sub\u2011agents raised the bar for <em>repeatable context assembly</em> vs. one\u2011off prompts. A single bad context decision can cascade through a 10\u2011step plan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Memory and standards arrived.</strong> Centralized user/org memory (and standards like MCP) make it feasible to load personal/org context <em>safely</em>\u2014if you design the layer properly. Without governance, you leak PII or overload the window.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Retrieval matured.</strong> Hybrid search, reranking, and graph\u2011aware retrieval (e.g., GraphRAG) reduce hallucinations and token waste. But only if you route queries to the right retrieval strategy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Value focus shifted.</strong> Many \"agentic\" pilots stall not because of model quality but because of weak context design/governance. A deliberate context layer is the fix.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"key-concepts-for-beginners\">Key Concepts for Beginners</h2>\n<p>Before we dive in, let's define a few terms that will appear frequently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context Window</strong>: The \"working memory\" of the model. It's the maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) the model can process at once. If you exceed it, the model crashes or forgets the beginning.</li>\n<li><strong>Tokens</strong>: The basic units of text for an LLM. Roughly, 1,000 tokens \u2248 750 words.</li>\n<li><strong>Embeddings</strong>: Numerical representations of text. We use them to search for \"meaning\" rather than just keywords (e.g., searching for \"dog\" might find \"puppy\").</li>\n<li><strong>JSON Schema</strong>: A standard way to describe the structure of JSON data. It allows us to force the model to output specific fields (like <code>{\"answer\": \"...\", \"citations\": [...]}</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>MCP (Model Context Protocol)</strong>: An open standard that enables AI models to interact with external data and tools securely. Think of it as a \"USB port\" for AI apps to connect to your local files, databases, or Slack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Context Window Composition\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-10-05-context-engineering/context_window_composition.svg\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-context-layer\">What is the context layer?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <strong>pipeline + policy</strong> that (1) <strong>selects &amp; structures</strong> inputs per step, (2) <strong>applies controls</strong> (format/safety/policy), and (3) <strong>feeds</strong> the model/agent with <strong>just\u2011enough, just\u2011in\u2011time</strong> context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of it as the assembly line that prepares exactly what the model needs to make a good decision\u2014nothing more, nothing less.</p>\n<p>There's no single canonical definition.

src=\"../../../../assets/2025-10-05-context-engineering/tool_execution_loop.svg\" /></p>\n<p><strong>A Note on MCP (Model Context Protocol)</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> is becoming the standard for how agents connect to tools and data. Instead of writing custom API wrappers for every service (Google Drive, Slack, Postgres), you run an \"MCP Server\" for each. Your agent (the \"MCP Host\") then automatically discovers the tools and resources available.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"MCP Architecture\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-10-05-context-engineering/mcp_context_architecture.svg\" /></p>\n<p>Using MCP simplifies the \"Tools\" and \"Knowledge\" components significantly because it standardizes the interface. You don't need to write custom glue code; you just connect the server.</p>\n<p><strong>Key concepts explained</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Idempotent</strong>: safe to retry without side effects. GET requests are idempotent (reading data twice doesn't change anything). POST/DELETE are not (creating twice creates duplicates; deleting twice may fail). Mark tools as idempotent so your agent knows which are safe to retry on failure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Postconditions</strong>: simple checks after a call. Examples:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>non_empty_result</code>: at least one item returned (catches failed searches)</p>\n</li>\n<li><code>status==\"ok\"</code>: API returned success code</li>\n<li><code>valid_json</code>: response parses correctly</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>within_bounds</code>: numeric result is reasonable (e.g., price &gt; 0)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fallback chain</strong>: retry (if idempotent) \u2192 degrade gracefully (use cached/default) \u2192 human-in-loop (escalate to support).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Concrete example</strong>:</p>\n<div

Add when error rate &gt; 5%.</li>\n<li><strong>Planners</strong>: agent builds multi-step plan before acting. Add when tasks require &gt; 3 sequential steps.</li>\n<li><strong>Sub-agents</strong>: delegate specialized tasks to specialized agents. Add when you have distinct domains (e.g., sales agent + support agent).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>When NOT to add</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't add reflections if the agent is already slow (each reflection doubles latency).</li>\n<li>Don't add planners for simple single-step tasks.</li>\n<li>Don't add sub-agents until you've validated the core context layer works reliably.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"evaluation-observability\">Evaluation &amp; observability</h2>\n<p>You can't improve what you don't measure.

Avoid these.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-stuff-the-window\">1. Stuff-the-window</h3>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: Dump every possible document, memory, and example into the context window on every query.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it fails</strong>: Context rot. The model gets confused by irrelevant information, performance degrades, and costs explode. Signal-to-noise ratio collapses.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Route adaptively. Use no retrieval for general queries. Use single-shot RAG for fact-based queries. Use iterative RAG only for complex multi-part queries. Compress and rerank aggressively.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Customer asks \"What is your refund policy?\" You don't need to load their purchase history, account settings, and last 10 support tickets. Just retrieve the refund policy document.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"2-unvalidated-tool-results\">2. Unvalidated tool results</h3>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: Agent calls a tool, gets back data, and immediately feeds it to the model without checking.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it fails</strong>: Malformed data crashes downstream logic. Null results cause hallucinations (\"the API returned nothing so I'll make something up\"). Security risks if tools return sensitive data unfiltered.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Always validate tool results against schema and postconditions. Check for non-empty results, correct types, reasonable bounds. If validation fails, retry (if idempotent) or degrade gracefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Tool returns <code>{\"price\": -100}</code>. Your validator should catch the negative price and refuse to proceed, not let the agent tell a customer their item costs minus $100.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"3-one-shot-everything\">3. One-shot everything</h3>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: Cram system policy, developer guidelines, examples, user query, memory, and knowledge into a single monolithic prompt for every query.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it fails</strong>: No separation of concerns. Can't update policies without breaking examples. Can't A/B test instructions vs. retrieval. Context window fills up with duplicate boilerplate.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Separate durable instructions (system policy, role, schemas) from step-specific context (user query, retrieved docs, current memory). Instructions live in system message. Context lives in user message or tool results.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: System message contains \"You are ACME support bot. Always cite sources. Output JSON per AnswerSchema.\" User message contains \"Customer Sam asks: Why is my API key not working? [Memory: Sam, account A-123, Pro plan] [Knowledge: 3 help articles].\"</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"4-unbounded-memory\">4. Unbounded memory</h3>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: Store every user interaction forever. Load all of it on every query.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it fails</strong>: Context window fills up with stale, irrelevant memories. Privacy risks (storing PII indefinitely). Performance degrades as memory grows.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Set retention policies (preferences 365d, episodic 90d, short-term session-only). Implement scoped retrieval (only load memories relevant to current query). Redact PII before storage.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Customer had an issue 2 years ago with product X. They're now asking about product Y. Don't load the 2-year-old issue; it's irrelevant and clutters the context.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"5-rag-everywhere\">5. RAG everywhere</h3>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: Retrieve documents for every single query, even \"What is 2+2?\" or \"Hello\".</p>\n<p><strong>Why it fails</strong>: Wastes latency and cost on retrieval when the model already knows the answer. Retrieval can inject noise (\"Here are 3 docs about addition...\") that confuses simple queries.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement adaptive RAG routing. No retrieval for general knowledge. Single-shot for fact-based queries. Iterative for complex queries. Use a classifier or simple heuristics to route.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: \"What is Python?\" \u2192 No retrieval (parametric). \"What is our Python style guide?\" \u2192 Single-shot RAG (retrieve company docs). \"Compare our Python and Java style guides, then suggest improvements based on industry best practices\" \u2192 Iterative RAG (multi-hop retrieval + synthesis).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"6-ignoring-guardrail-triggers\">6. Ignoring guardrail triggers</h3>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: Log guardrail violations but never review them. Assume they're false positives.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it fails</strong>: You miss real attacks (prompt injection, jailbreak attempts). You miss UX issues (users hitting policy limits frequently). You miss bugs (schema repairs shouldn't be frequent).</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Review guardrail triggers weekly. High input block rate? Users are confused about what's allowed\u2014improve onboarding. High output repair rate? Your schemas are wrong or instructions are unclear. Policy refusals? Add better error messages and alternatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: You see 50 \"policy refused\" triggers for \"Show me all customer emails\". Instead of ignoring, add a better error: \"I can't share customer contact info directly, but I can help you export a filtered list to your CRM. Would you like that?\"</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"7-no-evals\">7. No evals</h3>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: Ship context layer changes without testing them. \"It works on my demo query, ship it.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Why it fails</strong>: Silent regressions. You break citations, schema validity, or retrieval precision and don't notice until users complain. No way to compare A/B variants objectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Define 5\u201310 eval scenarios before shipping anything. Run them on every change. Track schema validity, citation rate, latency, cost. Alert on regressions.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: You tweak retrieval top-k from 10 to 5. Evals show citation rate drops from 90% to 70%. You roll back or adjust reranker threshold. Without evals, users would have gotten uncited answers for weeks.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"quick-wins-ship-these-today\">Quick wins: ship these today</h2>\n<p>If you already have an agent in production and want immediate improvements, start here. Each takes &lt; 1 day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-add-output-schema-validation\">1. Add output schema validation</h3>\n<p><strong>Impact</strong>: Catch 80% of errors before they reach users.</p>\n<p><strong>How</strong>: Define a JSON Schema for your output. Validate before returning. If invalid, attempt one repair (add missing fields with defaults). If still invalid, refuse with a clear error.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><a id=\"__codelineno-12-1\" name=\"__codelineno-12-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-12-1\"></a><span class=\"kn\">from</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">jsonschema</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">validate</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">ValidationError</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-12-2\" name=\"__codelineno-12-2\" href=\"#__codelineno-12-2\"></a>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-12-3\" name=\"__codelineno-12-3\" href=\"#__codelineno-12-3\"></a><span class=\"k\">def</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">auto_repair</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">output</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">dict</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ValidationError</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"nb\">dict</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-12-4\" name=\"__codelineno-12-4\" href=\"#__codelineno-12-4\"></a><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"sd\">&quot;&quot;&quot;Simple repair logic for common errors.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-12-5\" name=\"__codelineno-12-5\" href=\"#__codelineno-12-5\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">repaired</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">output</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">copy</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-12-6\" name=\"__codelineno-12-6\" href=\"#__codelineno-12-6\"></a>    <span class=\"c1\"># Example: Add missing &#39;metric&#39;

Introduction</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> is an open standard that enables AI assistants (like Claude) to connect to external data and tools. Instead of building custom integrations for every tool, MCP provides a universal language for AI models to interact with your world.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we will build a <strong>FeatureStoreLite</strong> MCP server. This server will act as a bridge between an LLM and a feature store (a database of precomputed ML features), allowing the LLM to query and retrieve feature vectors for users, products, or documents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-build-this\">Why build this?</h3>\n<p>Imagine you are an ML engineer debugging a pipeline. Instead of writing SQL queries or Python scripts to check feature values, you can simply ask Claude: <em>\"What is the feature vector for user_123?\"</em> or <em>\"Show me the metadata for product_abc\"</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-uv\">Why use <code>uv</code>?</h3>\n<p>We will use <strong><a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\">uv</a></strong>, an extremely fast Python package installer and project manager.

It means <strong>zero cloud costs</strong>, <strong>no censorship</strong>, <strong>total privacy</strong>, and <strong>unlimited experimentation</strong>. Whether you're generating character portraits, architectural concepts, or just having fun, your Mac is more than capable of handling the workload thanks to Apple Silicon.</p>\n<p>But with so many tools available, where do you start?</p>\n<p>Below is a practical guide to the best macOS-ready interfaces.

It's a single configuration file that holds your project's metadata, dependencies, and tool settings.

It uses the TOML format (think INI files but better) and is backed by official Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs).</p>\n<p>The file evolved in two key stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/\">PEP 518</a></strong> (2016) introduced the <code>[build-system]</code> table so build tools could declare their requirements in a standard way.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/\">PEP 621</a></strong> (2020) added the <code>[project]</code> table for core package metadata\u2014name, version, dependencies, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today, most Python developer tools (Black, isort, pytest, Ruff, mypy) read their configuration from <code>[tool.*]</code> sections in this file, making it the central hub for your entire project setup.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Structure\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-08-guide-pyproject-toml/pyproject_structure.svg\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-should-you-care\">Why should you care?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-one-file-to-rule-them-all\">1.

Now everything lives in one place.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-backend-agnostic-builds\">2. Backend-agnostic builds</h3>\n<p>When you run <code>pip install .</code>, pip reads <code>pyproject.toml</code> and automatically installs whatever build tools your project needs (setuptools, flit, hatchling, etc.).

Evolving Infrastructure for LLMs and Beyond</h1>\n<p>The field of machine learning has undergone a seismic shift with the rise of large-scale foundation models. From giant language models like GPT-4 to image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion, these powerful models have fundamentally changed how we build and operate ML systems.</p>\n<p>In this post, I'll explore how ML infrastructure and MLOps practices have evolved to support foundation models. We'll contrast the \"classic\" era of MLOps with modern paradigms, examine what's changed, and look at the new patterns and workflows that have emerged. Think of it as upgrading from a standard toolbox to a fully automated factory\u2014the principles are similar, but the scale and complexity are on a different level.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"1-the-mlops-landscape-a-few-years-ago-pre-foundation-model-era\">1. The MLOps Landscape a Few Years Ago (Pre-Foundation Model Era)</h2>\n<p>A few years back, MLOps primarily meant applying DevOps principles to machine learning. The goal was simple: automate the model lifecycle from data preparation to deployment and monitoring.</p>\n<p>Back then, ML systems were built around relatively smaller models, often trained from scratch on domain-specific data. Here's what the \"classic\" MLOps era looked like:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Classic MLOps Pipeline\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-06-from-mlops-to-llmops/classic_mlops_pipeline.svg\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"11-end-to-end-pipelines\">1.1. End-to-End Pipelines</h3>\n<p>Teams built end-to-end pipelines for data extraction, training, validation, and deployment. Apache Airflow orchestrated ETL and training workflows, while CI/CD systems ran automated tests and pushed models to production. The focus was on reproducibility and automation: package models in Docker containers, deploy them as REST microservices or batch jobs, and keep everything running smoothly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-experiment-tracking-and-model-versioning\">1.2. Experiment Tracking and Model Versioning</h3>\n<p>Managing experiments and versions was critical. Platforms like MLflow and Weights &amp; Biases (W&amp;B) became popular for logging training runs, hyperparameters, and metrics. Data scientists could compare experiments and reliably reproduce results. Models were registered in model registries with version numbers, making rollbacks straightforward when a new model underperformed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-continuous-training-cicd\">1.3. Continuous Training &amp; CI/CD</h3>\n<p>Classic MLOps pipelines emphasized continuous integration of new data and models. A typical pipeline might retrain a model nightly or weekly as new data arrived, run a battery of tests, and if tests passed, deploy the new model automatically. Automation tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD ensured that any change in data or code would trigger the pipeline reliably.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-infrastructure-and-serving\">1.4. Infrastructure and Serving</h3>\n<p>Serving a model in production meant a relatively small footprint\u2014perhaps a few CPU cores or a single GPU for real-time inference. Kubernetes and Docker became the standard for deploying scalable inference services. Monitoring focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance metrics</strong>: latency, throughput, memory usage</li>\n<li><strong>Model metrics</strong>: prediction accuracy, concept drift detection</li>\n<li><strong>System health</strong>: uptime, error rates</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"15-feature-stores-and-data-management\">1.5. Feature Stores and Data Management</h3>\n<p>For many ML applications (especially in finance or e-commerce), engineered features were as important as models. Feature stores provided a central place to manage features, ensuring consistency between training and serving. The emphasis was on structured data pipelines and feature engineering. Unstructured data like text and images required custom handling outside these stores.</p>\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: Classic MLOps revolved around small-to-medium models and explicit feature engineering. The tooling was designed for managing many experiments and deployments\u2014scaling out a large number of models for different tasks rather than scaling one enormous model. This paradigm worked well until models started growing dramatically in size and capability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-the-paradigm-shift-rise-of-large-scale-foundation-models\">2. The Paradigm Shift: Rise of Large-Scale Foundation Models</h2>\n<p>Around 2018-2020, everything changed. Researchers began introducing foundation models\u2014extremely large models pretrained on vast corpora, capable of being adapted to many tasks.</p>\n<p>The progression was rapid:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2018-2019</strong>: BERT and GPT-2 showed the power of transfer learning</li>\n<li><strong>2020-2021</strong>: GPT-3 and PaLM demonstrated what massive scale could achieve</li>\n<li><strong>2021-2023</strong>: Image models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion brought generative AI to the mainstream</li>\n<li><strong>2023-2024</strong>: Foundation models became ubiquitous\u2014available everywhere from Hugging Face to AWS Bedrock</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As one practitioner noted in early 2024: \"Foundational models are everywhere now\u2014a stark change from just two years ago.\"</p>\n<p>This shift created a fundamentally different paradigm. If classic models were like specialized kitchen gadgets (a toaster, a blender), foundation models are like a professional chef who can learn to cook anything with a little instruction.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Classic MLOps vs LLMOps\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-06-from-mlops-to-llmops/mlops_vs_llmops.svg\" /></p>\n<p>Here's how foundation models changed ML infrastructure:</p>\n<h3 id=\"21-pretrained-beats-from-scratch\">2.1. Pretrained Beats From Scratch</h3>\n<p>Instead of training models from scratch, teams started with powerful pretrained models and fine-tuned them for specific tasks. This approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cuts training time</strong> from weeks to hours or days</li>\n<li><strong>Reduces data requirements</strong> from millions to thousands of examples</li>\n<li><strong>Enables smaller teams</strong> to build sophisticated AI applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The largest models (with billions of parameters) are often used as-is via APIs or fine-tuned minimally. By 2024, the ML engineer's skillset shifted from \"how to build models\" to \"how to leverage and integrate foundation models\"\u2014treating the model as a service rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"22-model-size-and-computational-demands\">2.2. Model Size and Computational Demands</h3>\n<p>The sheer scale of these models introduced new challenges. A model with 175 billion parameters cannot be handled with the same infrastructure as one with 50 million parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>Key scaling challenges</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Training</strong>: Requires powerful hardware (GPUs, TPUs) and distributed computing</li>\n<li><strong>Model parallelism</strong>: Sharding a single model across multiple GPUs</li>\n<li><strong>Data parallelism</strong>: Synchronizing multiple GPU workers during training</li>\n<li><strong>Inference</strong>: Often requires multiple GPUs or specialized runtimes to keep latency acceptable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Libraries like DeepSpeed and ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer) were developed specifically to make training giant models feasible. The infrastructure requirements jumped by orders of magnitude.</p>\n<h3 id=\"23-emergence-of-llmops\">2.3. Emergence of LLMOps</h3>\n<p>It became clear that operating these large models in production required extensions to classic MLOps. This led to <strong>LLMOps</strong> (Large Language Model Operations)\u2014essentially MLOps specialized for large models.</p>\n<p>LLMOps builds on classic MLOps principles but addresses unique challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Computational resources</strong>: Managing expensive GPU clusters</li>\n<li><strong>Prompt engineering</strong>: Optimizing model behavior through input design</li>\n<li><strong>Safety monitoring</strong>: Detecting bias, harmful content, and data leakage</li>\n<li><strong>Performance management</strong>: Balancing latency, quality, and cost</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Issues that barely registered for smaller models\u2014like producing biased text or leaking training data\u2014became major considerations at LLM scale.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Nested relationship of MLOps specialties - Machine Learning Ops (outermost), Generative AI Ops, LLM Ops, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation Ops (innermost)\" src=\"https://www.nvidia.com/content/nvidiaGDC/us/en_US/glossary/mlops/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/nv_container_1795650_1945302252/nv_image_2134560435_.coreimg.100.1290.jpeg/1741240029246/ai-ops-hierarchy.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>This diagram from NVIDIA illustrates how general MLOps (outer circle) has branched into specialized subfields like generative AI operations (for all generative models), LLMOps (for large language models), and even RAGOps for retrieval-augmented generation. The concentric circles indicate that these specializations build on the foundation of classic MLOps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"24-foundation-models-as-a-service\">2.4. Foundation Models as a Service</h3>\n<p>Another major shift was the rise of <strong>models as a service</strong>. Instead of deploying their own models, many applications now call external APIs:</p>\n<p><strong>API Providers</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OpenAI, Cohere, AI21 Labs offer hosted LLMs</li>\n<li>Google's Vertex AI provides Model Garden with pretrained models</li>\n<li>AWS Bedrock hosts proprietary foundation models</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Model Hubs</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hugging Face hosts thousands of pretrained models</li>\n<li>Models can be downloaded or run in the cloud</li>\n<li>Version control and community sharing became standard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This changed ML architecture fundamentally. Production pipelines might call external APIs for inference, introducing new considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Latency</strong>: Network calls add overhead</li>\n<li><strong>Cost</strong>: Pay-per-token pricing models</li>\n<li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: Sending data to third parties</li>\n<li><strong>Vendor lock-in</strong>: Dependency on external services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But it also saves the massive effort of managing model infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>The paradigm shift</strong>: From \"your data + your model code = trained model\" to \"your data + adaptation of a pretrained model = fine-tuned model (or just prompt it with your data).\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-new-requirements-and-capabilities-in-modern-ml-infrastructure\">3. New Requirements and Capabilities in Modern ML Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>With foundation models at the center, today's ML infrastructure must support capabilities that were niche or non-existent just a few years ago. Here are the key new requirements:</p>\n<h3 id=\"31-distributed-training-and-model-parallelism\">3.1. Distributed Training and Model Parallelism</h3>\n<p>Training a model with billions of parameters is beyond the capacity of a single machine. Modern ML infrastructure orchestrates distributed training across multiple nodes:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Distributed Training\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-06-from-mlops-to-llmops/distributed_training.svg\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Two main approaches</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Model parallelism</strong>: Split the model's layers across multiple GPUs (each GPU handles part of the model)</li>\n<li><strong>Data parallelism</strong>: Replicate the model across GPUs and split the training data (synchronize gradients)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tools that enable this</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PyTorch Lightning, Horovod for general distributed training</li>\n<li>NVIDIA's Megatron-LM for massive transformer models</li>\n<li>Google's JAX/TPU ecosystem for TPU clusters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few years ago, most teams trained models on a single server. Now, ML platforms must handle launching jobs on GPU clusters, managing faults, and aggregating gradients from dozens or hundreds of workers seamlessly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"32-efficient-fine-tuning-techniques\">3.2. Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques</h3>\n<p>Training from scratch is impractical for huge models, but even fine-tuning a multi-billion parameter model can be resource-intensive. This led to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods:</p>\n<p><strong>Modern fine-tuning approaches</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)</strong>: Updates only a small subset of parameters (adapters) instead of the entire network, dramatically reducing computational cost</li>\n<li><strong>Prompt Tuning</strong>: Optimizes only the prompt embeddings, keeping the model frozen</li>\n<li><strong>Adapter Modules</strong>: Adds small trainable layers between frozen model layers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a simple example of how you might configure LoRA using the <code>peft</code> library:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><a id=\"__codelineno-0-1\" name=\"__codelineno-0-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-1\"></a><span class=\"kn\">from</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">peft</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">LoraConfig</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">get_peft_model</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-2\" name=\"__codelineno-0-2\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-2\"></a>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-3\" name=\"__codelineno-0-3\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-3\"></a><span class=\"c1\"># Configure LoRA</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-4\" name=\"__codelineno-0-4\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-4\"></a><span class=\"n\">peft_config</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">LoraConfig</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-5\" name=\"__codelineno-0-5\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-5\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">r</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">16</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-6\" name=\"__codelineno-0-6\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-6\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">lora_alpha</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-7\" name=\"__codelineno-0-7\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-7\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">target_modules</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;q_proj&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;v_proj&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-8\" name=\"__codelineno-0-8\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-8\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">lora_dropout</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mf\">0.05</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-9\" name=\"__codelineno-0-9\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-9\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">bias</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;none&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-10\" name=\"__codelineno-0-10\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-10\"></a>    <span class=\"n\">task_type</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;CAUSAL_LM&quot;</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-11\" name=\"__codelineno-0-11\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-11\"></a><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-12\" name=\"__codelineno-0-12\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-12\"></a>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-13\" name=\"__codelineno-0-13\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-13\"></a><span class=\"c1\"># Apply to base model</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-14\" name=\"__codelineno-0-14\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-14\"></a><span class=\"c1\"># model = get_peft_model(base_model, peft_config)</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-0-15\" name=\"__codelineno-0-15\" href=\"#__codelineno-0-15\"></a><span class=\"c1\"># model.print_trainable_parameters()</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>ML infrastructure must now support complex workflows: load a base model from a hub, apply fine-tuned weight deltas, and deploy the combined model. Traditional training pipelines evolved significantly to accommodate this multi-step customization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"33-prompt-engineering-management\">3.3. Prompt Engineering &amp; Management</h3>\n<p>One surprising new artifact in modern ML pipelines is <strong>the prompt</strong>. With LLMs, much of the model's behavior is controlled through the text prompt or input format you give it.</p>\n<p>This created an entirely new discipline. Teams now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain <strong>prompt libraries</strong> and templates</li>\n<li>Use <strong>version control</strong> for prompts (just like code)</li>\n<li>Run <strong>A/B tests</strong> to compare prompt variants</li>\n<li>Store <strong>prompt versions</strong> alongside model versions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is fundamentally different from classic ML, where inputs were just data features\u2014not natural language instructions. Frameworks like LangChain now include prompt optimization as a first-class feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Example prompt evolution</strong>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><a id=\"__codelineno-1-1\" name=\"__codelineno-1-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-1\"></a>v1: &quot;Classify this text as positive or negative: {text}&quot;\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-2\" name=\"__codelineno-1-2\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-2\"></a>v2: &quot;You are a sentiment analyzer. Classify: {text}&quot;\n<a id=\"__codelineno-1-3\" name=\"__codelineno-1-3\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-3\"></a>v3: &quot;Analyze sentiment. Return only &#39;positive&#39; or &#39;negative&#39;: {text}&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Each version can produce different results, so tracking and testing prompts became as important as tracking model weights.</p>\n<h3 id=\"34-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag\">3.4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h3>\n<p>Foundation models have a fixed knowledge cutoff and limited context windows. To keep responses accurate and up-to-date, <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> has become a best practice.</p>\n<p><strong>How RAG works</strong>:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"RAG Workflow\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-06-from-mlops-to-llmops/rag_workflow.svg\" /></p>\n<p>Instead of continuously retraining the model on new data (costly and slow), RAG fetches information at query time. The retrieved documents are appended to the prompt as additional context.</p>\n<p>Here's a simplified view of how this looks in code using LangChain:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><a id=\"__codelineno-2-1\" name=\"__codelineno-2-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-2-1\"></a><span class=\"kn\">from</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">langchain.vectorstores</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Pinecone</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-2-2\" name=\"__codelineno-2-2\" href=\"#__codelineno-2-2\"></a><span class=\"kn\">from</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">langchain.llms</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">OpenAI</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-2-3\" name=\"__codelineno-2-3\" href=\"#__codelineno-2-3\"></a><span class=\"kn\">from</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">langchain.chains</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">RetrievalQA</span>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-2-4\" name=\"__codelineno-2-4\" href=\"#__codelineno-2-4\"></a>\n<a id=\"__codelineno-2-5\" name=\"__codelineno-2-5\" href=\"#__codelineno-2-5\"></a><span class=\"c1\"># 1.

Unstructured data and semantic search took center stage over manual feature engineering.</p>\n<h3 id=\"35-data-streaming-and-real-time-data-feeds\">3.5. Data Streaming and Real-Time Data Feeds</h3>\n<p>Modern applications\u2014especially LLM-powered assistants\u2014continuously ingest data: chat conversations, sensor data, event streams. This data needs to update the model's knowledge (via RAG) or trigger responses in real-time.</p>\n<p><strong>The shift</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Classic MLOps</strong>: Batch processing (daily/weekly training jobs)</li>\n<li><strong>Modern LLMOps</strong>: Real-time streaming data pipelines</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Technologies driving this</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kafka</strong> and event streaming platforms</li>\n<li><strong>Real-time databases</strong> (Redis, DynamoDB)</li>\n<li><strong>Online feature stores</strong> with continuous updates</li>\n<li><strong>Streaming embeddings</strong> that update vector indexes in real-time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The boundary between data engineering and MLOps has blurred. Data pipelines now directly feed model inference rather than just training.</p>\n<h3 id=\"36-scalable-and-specialized-serving-infrastructure\">3.6. Scalable and Specialized Serving Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>Serving a massive model is challenging. Modern ML infrastructure must support three key capabilities:</p>\n<p><strong>High-Throughput, Low-Latency Serving</strong></p>\n<p>Interactive applications (chatbots, image generators) demand fast responses. This requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GPU/TPU acceleration</strong> for quick inference</li>\n<li><strong>Model quantization</strong> to reduce precision and speed up serving</li>\n<li><strong>GPU batching</strong> to serve multiple requests in parallel</li>\n<li><strong>Optimized serving engines</strong> like NVIDIA's TensorRT, Triton Inference Server, or DeepSpeed-Inference</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Serverless and Elastic Scaling</strong></p>\n<p>A new trend toward serverless ML has emerged. Platforms like Modal offer \"AWS Lambda but with GPU support\"\u2014you provide code, they handle infrastructure and scaling.</p>\n<p>Benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No always-running servers</li>\n<li>Compute spins up on-demand</li>\n<li>Scale to zero when idle (pay only per execution)</li>\n<li>Automatic scaling under load</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tradeoffs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cold-start latency when spinning up</li>\n<li>Managing statelessness</li>\n<li>Less control over infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This works well for irregular workloads where managing GPU clusters is overkill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distributed Model Serving</strong></p>\n<p>For models too large for a single GPU, inference itself can be distributed. The model is sharded across multiple machines, each handling part of the forward pass.</p>\n<p>Example: Serving a 175B parameter model on-premises requires multiple GPUs working together. Modern ML infrastructure must launch distributed inference replicas and route requests appropriately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"37-monitoring-observability-and-guardrails\">3.7. Monitoring, Observability, and Guardrails</h3>\n<p>With great power comes great responsibility. Large models can generate incorrect or inappropriate outputs in ways small models never did. Modern ML systems need three layers of monitoring:</p>\n<p><strong>Performance and Reliability</strong></p>\n<p>The basics still matter:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latency, throughput, memory usage</li>\n<li>GPU utilization and costs</li>\n<li>Autoscaling policies (scale up under load, fall back to smaller models if needed)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Output Quality and Safety</strong></p>\n<p>We now monitor the <em>content</em> of outputs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content filtering</strong>: Detect hate speech, PII, harmful content</li>\n<li><strong>Moderation APIs</strong>: Use OpenAI's moderation API or custom filters</li>\n<li><strong>Bias detection</strong>: Continuously evaluate for biased responses</li>\n<li><strong>Guardrails</strong>: Intercept adversarial inputs and ensure outputs stay within bounds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These \"guardrails\" have become essential in LLMOps\u2014they're not optional.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback Loops</strong></p>\n<p>Continuous improvement now includes human feedback:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collect user interactions (likes, corrections, ratings)</li>\n<li>Use feedback to fine-tune models or adjust prompts</li>\n<li><strong>RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)</strong>: Explicitly use human ratings to refine behavior</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The infrastructure must support collecting and managing this feedback data securely.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: Today's ML infrastructure manages entire ecosystems\u2014base models, fine-tuning adapters, prompt templates, retrieval indexes, monitoring detectors, and more. The complexity is higher, but so is the capability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-evolving-system-architecture-and-design-patterns\">4. Evolving System Architecture and Design Patterns</h2>\n<p>Given these new requirements, how are ML systems actually structured today? Here are the key design patterns that have emerged:</p>\n<h3 id=\"41-modular-pipelines-orchestration\">4.1. Modular Pipelines &amp; Orchestration</h3>\n<p><strong>Classic tools</strong> (Kubeflow Pipelines, Apache Airflow) are still used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fine-tuning workflows</li>\n<li>Batch scoring jobs</li>\n<li>Periodic model retraining</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>New tools</strong> have emerged for modern needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Metaflow, Flyte, ZenML</strong>: Pythonic workflows that integrate seamlessly with ML libraries</li>\n<li><strong>Lightweight orchestration</strong>: For low-latency inference, application code often replaces heavyweight workflow engines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key difference: engineers no longer need to leave their development environment to manage the flow from data to deployment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"42-model-hubs-and-registries\">4.2. Model Hubs and Registries</h3>\n<p>Model management evolved with centralized hubs:</p>\n<p><strong>External hubs</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hugging Face Hub</strong>: Thousands of models, datasets, and scripts</li>\n<li>One-stop shop for ML components</li>\n<li>Plug-and-play architecture (fetch models at startup)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Internal registries</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MLflow Registry, SageMaker Model Registry for bespoke models</li>\n<li>Combined with external foundation models</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The shift</strong>: Instead of building everything in-house, engineers now plan for how to fine-tune and adapt third-party models. This has accelerated development dramatically.</p>\n<h3 id=\"43-feature-stores-vs-vector-databases\">4.3. Feature Stores vs. Vector Databases</h3>\n<p>The data layer has fundamentally changed:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Feature Store vs Vector DB\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-06-from-mlops-to-llmops/feature_store_vs_vector_db.svg\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Traditional feature stores</strong> handled structured data with manual feature engineering.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern vector databases</strong> (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Milvus) handle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-dimensional embeddings</li>\n<li>Fast similarity search</li>\n<li>Semantic search and deduplication</li>\n<li>RAG for LLMs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You'll often see both: a vector DB for unstructured semantic lookup and a data warehouse for structured analytics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"44-unified-platforms-end-to-end\">4.4. Unified Platforms (End-to-End)</h3>\n<p>The complexity of modern ML has driven adoption of end-to-end platforms that abstract infrastructure details.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud platforms</strong> evolved to support foundation models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google Vertex AI</strong>: Auto-distributed training on TPU pods, Model Garden with LLMs, one-click deployment</li>\n<li><strong>AWS SageMaker</strong>: Distributed training, model parallelism, and Bedrock for hosted foundation models</li>\n<li><strong>Azure Machine Learning</strong>: Integrated training, deployment, and monitoring</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These platforms provide managed services like \"fine-tune this 20B parameter model on your data\" or \"embed and index your text data for retrieval.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Open-source and startups</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MosaicML</strong> (now Databricks): Efficient training and deployment for large models</li>\n<li><strong>Argilla, Label Studio</strong>: Data labeling and prompt dataset creation</li>\n<li><strong>ClearML, MLflow</strong>: Experiment tracking tied to pipeline execution</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"45-inference-gateways-and-apis\">4.5. Inference Gateways and APIs</h3>\n<p>The proliferation of model sizes led to <strong>inference gateways</strong>\u2014routers that intelligently direct requests:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Inference Gateway\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-06-from-mlops-to-llmops/inference_gateway.svg\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Use cases</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Route based on latency requirements</li>\n<li>Different models for different subscription tiers</li>\n<li>A/B testing new models on a fraction of traffic</li>\n<li>Fallback to smaller models under high load</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This decouples the client-facing API from model implementation, allowing seamless model swaps and testing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"46-agentic-systems\">4.6. Agentic Systems</h3>\n<p>A cutting-edge pattern: <strong>AI agents</strong> that dynamically choose sequences of actions to accomplish tasks.</p>\n<p>Unlike static chains, agents can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call external tools (calculators, search engines, databases)</li>\n<li>Decide workflows at runtime based on context</li>\n<li>Invoke different models for different subtasks</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Enabling frameworks</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LangChain's agent mode</li>\n<li>OpenAI's function calling</li>\n<li>AutoGPT and similar systems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This emerging pattern requires new operational practices (sometimes called \"AgentOps\"):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Robust monitoring to prevent unwanted actions</li>\n<li>Detailed logging to trace decision paths</li>\n<li>Safety guardrails to limit agent capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Agentic Workflow\" src=\"../../../../assets/2025-05-06-from-mlops-to-llmops/agentic_workflow.svg\" /></p>\n<p>While not yet widespread in production, agentic systems represent the frontier of LLMOps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-getting-started-with-llmops\">5. Getting Started with LLMOps</h2>\n<p>If you are new to this field, the ecosystem can feel overwhelming. Here is a recommended path to get your hands dirty:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Play with APIs</strong>: Start by using OpenAI or Anthropic APIs to understand prompt engineering.</li>\n<li><strong>Build a RAG App</strong>: Use <strong>LangChain</strong> or <strong>LlamaIndex</strong> to build a simple \"Chat with your PDF\" app. This introduces you to vector databases and retrieval.</li>\n<li><strong>Try Fine-Tuning</strong>: Use <strong>Hugging Face</strong> to fine-tune a small model (like Llama-3-8B or Mistral-7B) on a custom dataset using Google Colab.</li>\n<li><strong>Deploy</strong>: Try deploying your fine-tuned model using <strong>vLLM</strong> or <strong>Ollama</strong> locally, then move to a cloud provider.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"6-conclusion-from-mlops-to-llmops-and-beyond\">6. Conclusion: From MLOps to LLMOps and Beyond</h2>\n<p>In just a few years, we've witnessed a transformation in how we approach machine learning in production.</p>\n<p><strong>What remains the same</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automation, reproducibility, collaboration</li>\n<li>Focus on reliability and efficiency</li>\n<li>DevOps principles applied to ML</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What changed dramatically</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scale: From millions to billions of parameters</li>\n<li>Approach: From training from scratch to adapting foundation models</li>\n<li>Infrastructure: From single servers to distributed GPU clusters</li>\n<li>Data layer: From feature stores to vector databases</li>\n<li>Monitoring: From performance metrics to content safety guardrails</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This gave rise to <strong>LLMOps</strong>\u2014a specialization of MLOps for managing the lifecycle of large models. It's not just hype. The differences are tangible in day-to-day workflows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How we fine-tune models (LoRA, adapters)</li>\n<li>How we deploy them (distributed serving, serverless GPUs)</li>\n<li>How we monitor them (content filtering, bias detection)</li>\n<li>What infrastructure we need (vector databases, GPU clusters)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The evolution continues</strong>. As models grow and AI systems become more autonomous, we're already seeing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AgentOps</strong> for managing AI agents</li>\n<li><strong>RAGOps</strong> for retrieval-augmented systems</li>\n<li>Even more specialized operational practices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But the end goal remains: <strong>reliably deliver the benefits of machine learning to end-users and business applications, at scale and with trustworthiness.</strong></p>\n<p>Teams that successfully navigate this evolution harness foundation models to build products faster than ever\u2014while maintaining the reliability and efficiency that good operations provide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<p>The insights and examples in this post are supported by recent research and industry sources, including an MDPI review on transitioning from MLOps to LLMOps, NVIDIA's technical blogs on GenAIOps and LLMOps, and various practitioner articles and discussions capturing the state of ML in 2024.
